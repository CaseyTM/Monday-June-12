## Scope, hoisting and compartmentalization

### Answer the following:
In you own words, explain the concepts of scope, hoisting, compartmentalization.


### Provide examples for all three, below:

#### Scope:
scope defines the "playground that a given variable exists".  Two types, global and local where global is accessible to anything and local only accessible to methods which share it's same scope (inside the same function for ex.)

#### Hoisting:
first JS reads all variable declarations, allowing for existence but not definition of all variables. second js will read all
functions (with their definition) then after that JS will read as normal.

#### Compartmentalization:
to compartmentalize is to define a variable locally to it's place of use, using the "let" keyword (not sure if that's nec to meet definition)
